Conditional nativism is the process of employing racial collectivism\n  to form a positive orientation toward national identity. Using a national sample\n  of respondents from the 2016 Collaborative Multi-racial Post-election Survey (n\n  = 10,146), I explore the role of conditional nativism in shaping Black American\n  national identity. I find that while racial collectivism predicts a positive orientation\n  toward national identity, the degree of racial collectivism produces a negative\n  orientation toward national identity. These results underscore the role of racial\n  collectivism and conditional nativism in Black American orientation toward national\n  identity.\n---\n\n```{r data, include=FALSE, cache = TRUE, warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE}\nrm(list=ls())\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)\n\n\n\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(bookdown)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(readstata13)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(lmtest)\nlibrary(plm)\nlibrary(stargazer)\nlibrary(pROC)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(texreg)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\ncmps <- read.dta13(\"CMPS2016 book ms.dta\")\ncmps <- as_tibble(cmps)\n```\n\n```{r variables}\n\n\n#National identity index\ncmps$c107 <- as.numeric(cmps$c107) #belong\ncmps$c108 <- as.numeric(cmps$c108) #respect and value\ncmps$c109 <- as.numeric(cmps$c109) #how much do you feel like an outsider in the US\ncmps$c110 <- as.numeric(cmps$c110) #excluded\ncmps$natid <-(rev(cmps$c107) + rev(cmps$c108) + cmps$c109 + cmps$c110)/4\ncmps$natid <- cmps$natid \n#IVS\ncmps$allrace <- cmps$ethnic_quota\ncmps$allrace <- cmps$allrace\ncmps$Black <- cmps$s2_3\ncmps$White <- cmps$s2_1\ncmps$Latino <- cmps$s2_2\ncmps$Asian <- cmps$s2_4\n#Controls\ncmps$income <-as.numeric(cmps$c383)\ncmps$south <- cmps$south\ncmps$citizen <-cmps$citizen\ncmps$religion <- cmps$c129\ncmps$age <- as.numeric(cmps$age)\ncmps$age <- ggplot2::cut_number(cmps$age,10)\ncmps$age <- as.numeric(cmps$age)\ncmps$ed <- as.numeric(cmps$c381)\ncmps$native <- cmps$s7\ncmps$native <- ifelse(cmps$native == \"United States\", 1, 0)#Note that this does not include Puerto Rico.

Over time, policy cues reinforced non-White individuals’ “Otherness” from public life and, ultimately, national identity (Acharya, Blackwell, and Sen 2016; Vargas, Sanchez, and Valdez 2017; Alexander and West 2020). Finally, Reconstruction and Jim Crow laws institutionalized race-based exclusion from Whites in all public domains. These included systematic exclusion from resources, education, gainful employment, and the various remaining norms and protections of civic life (Alexander and West 2020). Together, citizenship, policy, and exclusion cues constitute the racial stratification of the American national identity – forging distinct national identity experiences for White and non-White Americans.\n\nBlack Americans have responded to the race-based exclusion by adopting racial collectivism as a critical group norm (Dawson 1994). Racial collectivism is an individual’s belief that what happens to members of one’s racial group matters for their individual life (Dawson 1994). I argue that racial collectivism informs Black American orientation toward their American national identity. Figure 2 displays the proportion of each racial group that ascribes to racial collectivism. The “None” category represents those who viewed what happens to members of their racial group as unimportant to how they view themselves. Black Americans are more likely than any other group to report racial collectivism. Black Americans are also most likely to feel strongly that racial collectivism matters to their lives.\n\nWhat is the relationship between racial and national identity for Black Americans? Figure 2 reports orientation toward national identity among the four main racial subgroups of American national identity. Among Black Americans, 61% feel strongly that they belong in the United States, 95% felt any sense of belonging at all. Comparatively, 76% of White Americans feel strongly that they belong to the American national identity, while 93% feel. Unsurprisingly, Black Americans are most likely to feel strongly like outsiders (7%) excluded from their national identity (7%). In summary, Black Americans, as a subgroup, feel both positively and negatively toward their national identity. Why would Black Americans, historically oppressed by American society, feel any sense of national identity? I suspect that racial collectivism motivates a positive orientation toward their national identity. Racial collectivism predicts racial groups members’ political behavior, including increased political participation, more generous support for inter-racial group coalitions, liberal views about policy, high participation rates, and the behavior of political elites (Dawson 1994; Miller et al. 1981; Sanchez 2006a; Sanchez and Vargas 2016). Under certain circumstances, racial collectivism can motivate an individual to prioritize group interests over individual interests (White, Laird, and Allen 2014). Therefore, I expect racial collectivism to inform\nBlack American national identity.\n\nI begin by reviewing social identity theory. Mainly, I highlight how individuals cope with feelings of exclusion from an identity. I propose that racial collectivism as a mechanism to cope with the feelings of race-based exclusion from the American national identity. I use survey data from the 2016 Collaborative Multi-Ethnic Post Election Survey to model Black attachment to national identity. I find that Black Americans who report racial collectivism hold positive views toward their national identity. However, those with the strongest racial collectivism levels are more likely to be negative toward their national identity. These findings suggest a need for more comprehensive theories of race and national identity.\n\n```{r linkedfate-descriptives, cache= TRUE, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE, echo= FALSE, fig.cap=\"displays the degree of linked fate across racial groups.

Intragroup status is determined by one’s proximity to a group’s prototype. There are various subgroups within a sizeable super-ordinate identity, such as the American identity. Subgroups can racial, gender, or partisan groups. All fit within the umbrella identity of the American superordinate identity.\n\nWithin the United States’ racial hierarchy, Blacks are a relatively low-status group as they differ greatly from the White American prototype.  Exclusion creates negative psychological stress because it violates the individual’s need for belonging (Baumeister and Leary 1995; Tajfel and Turner 1979). Exclusion feels like rejection, and rejection is a painful experience that individuals are motivated to resolve (Tajfel and Turner 1979; Turner, Brown, and Tajfel 1979). When the status of an individual’s identity becomes threatened by exclusion, such as Black Americans within the American national identity, an individual is motivated to relieve any negative psychological stress associated therein (Brewer 1999). While we know that Black’s relative low-status as a group influences their public opinion on national identity (Carter and Pérez 2016) no work has been done to examine the role of the relative status on attachment to national identity. Thus, I present a novel approach to national identity by studying Black American naitonal identiy.\n\n## Racial Collectivism\nBlack Americans have coped with feelings of exclusion from their identity with strong racially collectivist beliefs. In Behind the Mule, Michael Dawson (1994) introduces the concept of linked fate. Linked fate is the utility heuristic that helps determine the extent to which individual actions (inaction) can produce group-level benefits (costs). The theory of linked fate has been extended to other racial and demographic identifiers, but not always appropriately. Much of Black political behavior is in favor of group interests.\n\nIs linked fate the same for all groups? Evidence suggests that this is only true for Black Americans (Stephens-Dougan 2016; Sanchez and Vargas 2016). For non-Blacks, linked fate operates on a differenttheoretical and empirical dimension than group consciousness. (Sanchez and Vargas 2016). Why are theydifferent? A history of shared discrimination drives linked fate for Blacks and Asians (Sanchez and Vargas2016). In contrast, language preference and nativity drive Latino linked fate (Sanchez and Vargas 2016). Inshort, linked fate is different for Blacks because the nature of their discrimination.\n\nBecause Blacks are afraid of behaving in a way that might present costs to the rest of their group, individualsare constrained by following their self-interest. For these reasons I expect racial collectivism to inform nationalidentity. My theory describes the process through which racial collectivism informs Black American nationalidentity and is described below. Throughout this paper, I use the terms linked fate, racial collectivism, andcollectivism interchangeably. Each term expresses the idea that what matters for the racial group matters the individual.\n\n## National Identity \n\nRupert Emerson defined national identity as “a body of people who feel that they are a nation (Emerson 1960, p. 102). I operationalize national identity through the framework of social identity theory. SIT theory”provides guidance on the measurement of national attachments, produces a non-ideological measure that evades contention over the meaning of American patriotism, and generates testable and empirically substantiated predictions\" of\nindividual behavior (Huddy and Khatib 2007, p. 74). \n\nNational identity is associated with being White in the United States (Devos and Banaji 2005). Centuries of White domination of political spaces have forged a race-based definition of the Americannational identity. The result is the race-based exclusion of Black Americans from the American body politic (Shklar 1991). Racial assimilation is impossible because of the immutability of Black skin (Chandra and Wilkinson 2008). While one can move to another country, one cannot move to another racial category. Black Americans are left to negotiate their position through political processes, including, but not\nlimited to, such actions like voting, mobilizing group interests, and forming winning political coalitions within the public. \n\nImportantly, national identity is different from symbolic, constructive, uncritical patriotism, nationalism (Huddy and Khatib 2007); and citizenship (Dalton 2008); is akin but distinct from nationalism (Huddy and Khatib 2007) and least like patriotism (Huddy and Khatib 2007; McDaniel, Nooruddin, and Shortle 2016). There are three significant values associated with the American national identity. First, Americans believe that Americans speak English and believe in God. Next, the perception of American identity influences the perception of minorities and society’s well-being. Finally, Americans believe national identity is best expressed through civic “duty” (Citrin, Reingold, and Green 1990).\n\nAs a measure, national identity outperforms all other measures in the ability to predict civic engagement (Huddy and Khatib me 2007). National identity has an equal endorsement from conservatives and liberals alike and improves among immigrant groups over time (Huddy and Khatib me 2007). Importantly, national identity evades racial differences in opinion (Huddy and Khatib 2007).\n\n\n# Black American National Identity: A Theory\nDo individuals care about their racial or national identities more? Political science remains uncertain of the answer. Triandafyllidou (2010) argues that national identity is the most important for all persons in a nation. However, racial collectivism drives non-White attachment to national identity (Citrin, Wong, and Duff 2001). Interestingly, Whites (78%) were the only group to view themselves as exclusively American. Black Americans were most likely (27%) to say they view themselves as Black exclusively. Moreover, Huddy and Khatib (2007) find that Blacks have a negative orientation toward national identity. Thus the question of the relationship between racial and national identity is left unanswered.\n\nSo far, the literature has identified that national identity cues operate differently for racial groups. We know that those with stronger attachments to national identity are more likely to respond to national identity cues for political participation (Dalton 2008; Klandermans 2014; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; Valenzuela and Michelson 2016a). However, little research considers the mechanism that motivates national identity to vary by race. In other words, how do non-White Americans form their orientation toward national identity? I argue that persistent racial discrimination has left non-White Americans feeling excluded from the national identity. As a result, non-White groups have chosen alternative mechanisms to understand their own national identity. The mechanism through which non-White Americans infer their national identity is what I refer to as racial collectivism. I explain the role of racial collectivism below.\n\nThere are two possible effects of the role of racial collectivism on Black American national identity. On the one hand, Black Americans are likely to evaluate how Blacks as a whole have been discriminated against when evaluating their attachment to national identity. In this scenario, Black Americans will feel negatively toward their national identity. On the other hand, Black Americans may cope with this negative feeling by choosing an alternative referent group through which Black Americans who report racial collectivism will have a positive orientation toward national identity.\n\nI argue that Black Americans engage in the latter, using their racial identity to compensate for their American national identity exclusion. Why? Because according to social identity theory, individuals are motivated to feel optimistic about their identities (Tajfel et al. 1971; Tajfel and Turner 1979). I theorize that racial collectivism is a cognitive mechanism that enables Black Americans to turn their negative attachments into positive ones. This construct is both politically consequential and theoretically imperative to the study\nof American politics.\n\n>Hypothesis 1: Linked fate will improve positive orientation toward national identity. \n\nMoreover, I expect those who report the highest levels of linked fate to report different racial collectivism levels than those who feel the lowest linked fate levels. We know that an individual’s attachment to an identity is distinct from membership in an identity group with consequences for political behavior (Green, Palmquist, and Shickler 2002; Huddy, Mason, and Aarøe 2015a; Suhay 2014). For example, we know that those with stronger attachments to national identity are more likely to respond to national identity cues for political participation (Dalton 2008; Klandermans 2014; Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; Valenzuela and Michelson 2016a). Since I am unsure of the nature of conditional nativism as a mechanism, I remain agnostic to collectivist intensity’s potential role.\n\n>Hypothesis 2: Black Americans with strong linked fate will report different national identity than their counterparts.\n\nFinally, my theory suggests that racial collectivism is a coping mechanism for low-status groups within the American national identity. As a result, I expect racial collectivism to have no effect on White Americans as the dominant racial group of the American national identity. If true, collectivism should not be statistically significant for White Americans.\n\n>Hypothesis 3: Linked fate will influence low-status and non-dominant groups. \n\n# Methodology \nThis paper uses data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (Barreto et al. 2017). The 2016 CMPS includes more than 10,000 respondents, including 1,032 “Whites”; 3,102 “Black/African Americans”; 3,003 Latinx (Latinx/a “/”Hispanic“); and 3,006”Asian“/” Asian Americans\" all self-identified. The survey was conducted via a “random to web” method such that emails were selected randomly from registered voters and commercial vending lists. Individuals associated with those emails were contacted and invited to participate in an online survey. Approximately 40% of the individuals on registered voter lists provided an email address. Invitations and surveys were provided in a bilingual format (English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese). The response rate was 9.9%.\n\nThe full data are weighted within each racial group to match the adult population in the 2015 Census ACS 1-year data file for age, gender, education, nativity, ancestry, and voter registration status. The data underwent an algorithmic post-stratification raking to balance each category within +/- 1 percent of the ACS estimates. Additionally, the number of Whites in the sample (n=1,032) is sufficient to make meaningful comparisons and inferences from the data.\n\nThe CMPS provides a large-sample of Black Americans to understand national identity. While the CMPS is not truly a representative sample, the concentration of non-Whites allows us to study understudied groups’ political behavior. Furthermore, few surveys combine the measure of linked fate and national identity. The CMPS provides a unique opportunity to study racial collectivism and national identity.\n\nI use an OLS model to measure racial collectivism’s role in predicting a positive or negative orientation toward national identity. My dependent variable is “national identity.” Conceptually, this captures an individual’s self-identification as a member of the American identity.\n\nImportantly, I operationalize national identity as separate from citizenship. National identity is an individual’s self-identified allegiance to the United States and its governing values. I am interested in how individuals perceive their national identity. I forge a national identity index using a variety of national identity items. The index includes questions addressing a sense of belonging, respect, exclusion, and feelings of being an outsider from the American national identity (see Appendix for more information). National identity is continuous with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 3. Low values denote a negative orientation toward national identity. Conversely, high values denote a positive attachment toward national identity.\n\nMy primary measure of interest is “racial collectivism.” To do so, I use the traditional measure of linked fate, “Do you think what happens generally to [racial group] people in this country will have something to do with what happens in your life?” Linked fate captures the role of collectivism in orientation toward national identity. This variable takes on the value of “1” if the respondent is collectivist and “0” if the respondent is individualistic. I expect racial collectivism to forge positive views of national identity. \n\nTo test my second hypothesis, I include the second measure of collectivism, the degree of linked fate. Respondents are then asked to select whether collectivism matters “not very much,” “somewhat,” or “a lot” to their outcomes. The intensity of linked fate captures the degree to which individuals feel racial collectivism matters to their own life. Those with strong racial collectivism look different from individuals with weak or moderate racial collectivism.\n\nFinally, I control other factors related to identity, including income, age, citizenship, female, education, partisanship, and native-born. I measure income, age, and education as categorical variables. Partisanship is the traditional 7 point measure of partisan identity (Green, Palmquist, and Shickler 2002). Further, native-born takes on “1” if the individual is born here and “0” if they are not. These measures account for competing explanations of attachment to national identity.\n\n# Results\n\nI am interested in the role of collectivism on Black orientation toward national identity. Table 1 reports three separate OLS models. In the first model, I measure Black American attachment to national identity without racial collectivism. Model 2 includes a measure of linked fate to capture the relationship between racial collectivism and national identity. Finally, Model 3 includes a measure of intensity to capture strong versus weak racial collectivists’ disparate impact. National identity is the dependent variable for each of the three models.\n\nMy first hypothesis predicts that racial collectivism will create a positive orientation toward national identity. Model 1 reports the role of collectivism among Black Americans. Here, female respondents weremore likely to have a positive orientation toward national identity than males. Additionally, older individuals are more likely to have a favorable view of their national identity than younger Black Americans. My second\nmodel measures racial collectivism. The data supports my first hypothesis that racial collectivism creates a positive orientation toward national identity. In this view, racial collectivism provides Black Americans with an alternative referent to form their national identity attachment. In practice, this suggests that Black Americans use racial collectivism as a heuristic to form a positive orientation toward their national identity.\n\nNotably, Black female respondents were more likely to positively view their national identity, even when for racial collectivism. Furthermore, partisanship is not a statistically significant factor in predicting Black national identity. Racial collectivism matters for Black Americans regional, partisan, and socioeconomic groups.\n\nMy second hypothesis predicts that those with the highest racial collectivism levels will have a different orientation toward national identity than those with low racial collectivism. Model 2 looks at the role of the degree of collectivism on a positive orientation toward national identity. Statistically, there was no difference between individuals who report moderate collectivism and those who reported low collectivism on positiveorientation toward national identity. However, those who reported high collectivism differed from those with low collectivism. This means that strong collectivist feelnegatively toward their national identity sex, citizenship, nativity, and partisan and socioeconomicidentities. Interestingly, the **negative** effect of strong collectivism is twice the size of the positive effect of linked fate.\n\nAll in all, the data supports my second hypothesis that strong racial collectivists will behave differently than weak racial collectivists. Surprisingly, the coefficient for intensity differs in both size, procuring a net negative effect for strong collectivist. Perhaps this may be attributed to awareness. Those with the strongest collectivism may be more aware. Those most aware of race-based exclusion’s threat might be more likely to feel negatively toward the identity.\n\nNotably, racial collectivism outperforms partisanship, education, and income in predicting Black American national identity. All three coefficients were small and insignificant. This result suggests that Black Americans are more likely to employ racial collectivism as a heuristic for understanding national identity than other social groupings like their socioeconomic class or partisan identity. This result suggests that race-based exclusion from the national identity could influence Black American national identity either directly or indirectly.\n\nMy final hypothesis compares the role of racial collectivism in high-status groups. To do so, I examine the role of racial collectivism for White Americans. Doing this allows me to isolate the effect of collectivism for White Americans. Table 2 reports three models measuring White American national identity. Model 2 reports the role of racial collectivism in White national identity. Unsurprisingly, the effect of racial collectivism on White national identity is both zero and statistically insignificant.\n\nThe same is true for the effect of the degree of collectivism for White Americans. Model 3 measures the effect of the strength of racial collectivism on national identity for White Americans. Neither moderate nor strong collectivists behaved differently than the non-collectivist. This result suggests that the level of racial collectivism does not influence White national identity. As a result, these null findings among White Americans support my theory that conditional nativism is a mechanism for low-status groups to cope with race-based exclusion.\n\nIn contrast to Black Americans, White American national identity is influenced by partisanship. Table 4 reports that a one unit increase in partisanship plays a role in orientation toward national identity. The data support my first hypothesis that racial collectivism will create a positive orientation toward national identity. There are two reasons why racial collectivism works for low-status groups. Experiences of discrimination are central to the Black American group identity (Sanchez and Vargas 2016). Racial collectivism allows Black Americans to feel connected to the American identity because Blacks are aware that they share this national identity – with all discrimination and potential therein – with other Blacks.\n\n# Discussion\n\nAll in all, this analysis provides preliminary support that racial collectivism influences national identity. The data support my first hypothesis that racial collectivism will create a positive orientation toward national identity. There are two reasons why racial collectivism works for low-status groups. Experiences of discrimination are central to the Black American group identity (Sanchez and Vargas 2016). Conditional nativism allows Black Americans to feel connected to the American identity because Blacks are aware that they share this national identity – with all discrimination and potential therein – with other Blacks.\n\nFurthermore, the data suggest that strong racial collectivists behave differently than weak racial collectivists. Linked fate created a positive orientation toward national identity. However, those with the highest collectivism level held a negative perception of Blacks’ national identity. Empirically, this suggests that racial collectivism is conceptually distinct from the intensity of one’s racial collectivism. Theoretically, this suggests that those who feel most attached to their racial group are more likely to be aware of threats and discrimination toward the racial group.\n\nThe salience of racial collectivism provides an alternative referent to understand one’s relative position as an American. Since Blacks are highly collectivistic, they are aware of group grievances in the United States. However, they feel positive toward their national identity because they know they are not alone in their collective aim for subgroup well-being. As a result, racial collectivism motivates individuals to form a positive orientation toward national identity. So long as other Black Americans are present in the United States, there is sufficient motivation to feel positively toward their national identity. Conditional nativism provides a way for Black Americans to feel positively toward their American identity. In this way, conditional nativism satisfies the psychological need to feel positively toward their national identity as a group member (Tajfel et al. 1971; Tajfel and Turner 1979).\n\nThe distinction between identity membership and identity salience fits in with current theories of social identity. For example, partisan identities, are distinct from intensity measures of partisanship (Green, Palmquist, and Shickler 2002). Partisan identities are group identities and reflect an individual’s attachment to that group.  Alternatively, the intensity of partisanship measures the degree of attachment to that group. This is important because strong attachment to a group predicts different behavior than weak attachment (Campbell et al. 1960; M. Dawson 1994; Green, Palmquist, and Shickler 2002; Huddy, Mason, and Aarøe 2015). Understanding the role of conditional nativism may offer insight into the forces that drive Black American patriotism, partisanship, and participation in American Politics.\n\n\nFurthermore, the use of racial collectivism to evaluate national identity suggests evidence of a process I call conditional nativism. Conditional nativism is the process of using an alternative referent to evaluate national identity. If conditional nativism is the process, then collectivism, or racial collectivism, is the mechanism through which Black Americans form their national identity.\n\n\nUnderstanding Black American national identity is essential for understanding Black American political participation, political attitudes, and partisanship. For example, national identity cues’ effectiveness differs across racial groups and attachment to national identity (Sanchez 2006b; Transue 2007; Valenzuela and Michelson 2016b). Sanchez (2006b) finds that Latinos who are more Americanized were more likely to respond to American national identity cues than less-Americanized Latinos. Similarly, we might expect Blacks who feel more American to be more responsive to American identity cues than those who feel less American. Still,\nit could be that the substance and nature of “Black American-hood” are distinct unto itself.\n\nAdditionally, discrimination experiences shape partisan attachments for non-White Americans (Kuo, Malhorta, and Hyunjung Mo (2017). This underscores research that social identities influence our partisan identities (Margolis 2017; Mason 2018). One possible explanation for the allegiance of Black Americans to the Democratic party may be rooted in race-based exclusion from the American national identity. If those with high racial collectivism levels have a negative orientation toward national identity, these individuals may be more likely to be aware of discrimination and, therefore, a Democratic party member. Thus, both the presence and degree of racial collectivism can be important for understanding Black and non-White political behavior.\n\nIn response to race-based exclusion from national identity, Black Americans have implemented a condi- tionally native orientation toward national identity. I combine major themes from social identity and political psychology to observe Black orientation toward the American national identity. My theory suggests that racial collectivism is an alternative referent through which low-status individuals orient their national identity.\n\nWhile this study is insufficient to conclude the role of racial collectivism, it does provide a starting point for understanding Black American national identity in the United States. Specifically, Black Americans are not uniquely “racial” but uniquely collectivist. Thus, their strong sense of racial collectivism serves as a mechanism for processing information related to the American national identity.\n\nSeveral lessons emerge from these conclusions. First, when we fail to isolate non-White groups in our measurement, we introduce unnecessary errors into our models. Second, racial collectivism is a powerful mechanism for non-White Americans. I demonstrated that racial collectivism improves Black orientation toward national identity. While Black Americans are comforted by the presence of other Blacks to produce a positive national identity, the role of racial collectivism varies by intensity. Those who report the highest levels of collectivism are more likely to hold negative views. Together, these results suggest that collectivism plays a complex yet central role in Black American attachment to national identity. Second, this paper underscores the need for accurate measurement of non-White political behavior by comparing Blacks to non-Blacks and not just White Americans.\n\nThis work underscores the need to study conditional nativism as a politically relevant mechanism subgroup conflict. It might be easy to believe I have described Black Americans as “un-American.” However, that would be an incorrect interpretation. Instead, I argue that Black Americans manage their feelings of discriminatory exclusion from the American national identity with a subgroup-based orientation toward their national identity.\n\n# References\n\nAcharya, Avidit, Matthew Blackwell, and Maya Sen. 2016. “The Political Legacy of American Slavery.” Journal of Politics 78(3): 621–41.\n\nAlexander, Michelle, and Cornel West. 2020.
